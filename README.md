# Durian Recognition App
Durian Recognition App is an Android application that uses deep learning techniques to recognize different species of durian leaves. With this app, users can upload images from their gallery or take pictures of durian leaves and get predictions on the species of the durian.

# Features
Upload images from the gallery or take pictures using the device's camera.
Utilizes TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library, trained with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize durian leaf species.
Provides predictions on the species of the uploaded durian leaves.
Supports recognition of three types of durian based on a dataset of 100 images for each type.

# Requirements
Android Studio: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
Android device/emulator: The app requires an Android device or emulator with a camera to capture images.

# Usage
1. Launch the Durian Recognition App on your Android device.

2. Choose to either upload an image from the gallery or take a picture using the device's camera.

3. Once an image is selected or captured, the app will process it using TensorFlow's trained CNN model.

4. After processing, the app will display the predicted species of the durian leaf.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the durian recognition model consists of 300 images, with 100 images for each of the three types of durian leaves. The dataset was collected and labeled specifically for this project.
